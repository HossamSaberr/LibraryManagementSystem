## Library Management System (Java, OOP)

Designed and implemented a robust Library Management System using Java, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming principles for efficient code organization and scalability. The system effectively manages library resources, providing features for book cataloging, user management, and transaction tracking. Implemented a user-friendly interface for librarians to perform tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting books, as well as managing member details. Utilized OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enhance code modularity and maintainability. Implemented features for book borrowing, returning, and generating reports, ensuring seamless library operations. This project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, OOP design principles, and the ability to create practical, user-centric software solutions.
